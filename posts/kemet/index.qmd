# Overview

They were Black. The fact this is still being debated despite the abundance of evidence to support it and the absence of evidence to dispute it is shameful.

With that said, here are the key findings detailed in Dr. Cheikh Anta Diop's "The African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality." His work, particularly the case he and Dr. Theophile Obenga presented at 1974 Cairo Symposium, has arguably been the most impactful on reversing the Eurocentric corruption of world history regrading Khemet and the entire Nile River Valley civilization.

1. Linguistic Evidence: Diop analyzed the language and writing system of ancient Egypt, asserting that Egyptian belonged to the Afro-Asiatic language family.^[The naming of the Afro-Asiatic language family is an example of one of the many tactics used to strip Africa of her legacy. The only 'Asiatic' branch of the language family is Semitic, which in addition to Hebrew and Arabic consists primarily of languages found in the Horn of Africa. On top of this, all of the languages can actually be considered African because the Arabian peninsula is, and even more so in the times of antiquity was, an extension of the African continent. The deliberate separation of the Arabian peninsula and North Africa through designations such as the Middle East and sub-Sahara was done to facilitate robbing Africa of her geographic territory and robbing Africans of their history and contributions to mankind.] He highlighted the numerous similarities in between Egyptian and other African languages, particularly his native Wollof.

2. Cultural Affinities: Diop examined cultural practices, religious beliefs, and social structures in ancient Egypt, drawing parallels with African cultures. He highlighted the presence of matrilineal kinship systems, totemism, and communal values, which are associated with African societies the world over.

3. Physical Anthropology: Diop studied the physical characteristics of ancient Egyptians, demonstrating their affinity to African populations. He argued that the predominant physical traits, such as cranial measurements and melanin levels, aligned with those of indigenous African populations.

4. Archaeological Evidence: Diop examined archaeological findings, including artwork, burial practices, and artifacts, to support the African origins of Egyptian civilization. He emphasized the presence of distinctly African features in Egyptian art and highlighted cultural continuity with earlier African civilizations.

5. Historical Connections: Diop traced historical connections between ancient Egypt and other African civilizations, emphasizing trade routes, cultural exchanges, and shared knowledge. He argued that Egypt played a central role in the cultural and intellectual development of Africa, which influenced neighboring regions.

6. Intellectual Contributions: Diop highlighted the intellectual achievements of ancient Egyptians, such as advancements in medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and architecture. He argued that these accomplishments aligned with the intellectual traditions of African societies.
