## **1. Reclaiming African History**

The Senegalese embrace and take pride in African culture and history more than any country or city I've been to. I've been to places in Africa and the diaspora where they take pride in their specific country or culture and African history as a whole. But nowhere have I seen such a display pride Africaness/Blackness. From the many museums to the names of locations to the Pan-African graffiti that decorates Dakar, there is no doubt that Senegalese are proud to be African.

History has and is being stolen from us. All mankind has been robbed of the truth, and we as Africans have been robbed of our history. While there have been many scholars who have gone to great lengths to restore our history,[^1] Dr. Cheik Anta Diop . The Senegalese polymath used his training in history, anthropology, linguistics, and chemistry to support the facts that:

[^1]: In addition to Dr. Diop, here are just a few of the other scholars who have defended the Africaness of Acient Egypt:

    -   Dr. John Henrik Clark
    -   Dr. Yousef Ben Jochanan
    -   Dr. Ivan van Sertima
    -   Dr. Theophile Obenga
    -   Dr. Runoko Rashidi
    -   Dr. Christopher Ehret
    -   Mr. Robin Walker
    -   Dr. Anthony Browder
    -   And many, many more

-   man originated in Africa
-   civilization originated in Africa
-   Ancient Egypt was a Black, African civilization

In honor of his many accomplishments, the University of Dakar, where he established a radiocarbon dating laboratory, was renamed to the University of Cheikh Anta Diop. I got a chance to visit the campus and was moved by all of the Pan-African murals and graffiti covering walls.

 

 

## **2. Africa's Largest Statue**

The African Renaissance Monument is a 49 m (161 ft) tall bronze statue representing the triumph of African liberation and rebirth of the African man and his family. The monument symbolizes the need to reclaim the power, heritage, and legacy of Africa.

## **3. Gorée Island - Living Memorial of the African Holocaust**

Gorée Island is a small island located off the coast of Dakar. It was a hub of the Atlantic slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries. On Goree there is the House of Slaves, where captured Africans were detained before setting sail to enslavement in the West. Now a small town with \~1,500 inhabited, Gorée also has a museum, restaurants, shops, hotels, a clinic, and a school.

## **5. Dope Art Scene**

Dakar has a vibrant art scene, a lot of which promotes Pan-Africanism and Black pride. Graffiti draping the entire city can be seen on buildings and bridges and whatnot. Sculptures and statues of Senegalese heroes, animals, and so much more are everywhere. And if you want to see a lot of artwork in one place, you have several museums and art galleries as options.
