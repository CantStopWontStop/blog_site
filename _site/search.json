And a lot of Us, went back this year, and by us I don’t just mean Sierra Leoneans and I don’t just mean Sierra Leone. Africans and people of African decent went back home, back to Africa. We all see Ghana has been going ham.\nBut it is not about fun…it not only about having fun.\nAs Africans, Black people, people of African decent (words I generally use interchangeably), we all need to go back…not just physically, not just recreationally, and not just temporarily.\nWe need to go back in so many more ways. We need to go back spiritually. We need to go back financially. We need to go back politically. We need to go back academically.\nYou see our history has and is being stolen from us. All mankind has been robbed of the truth and Africans around the world have been robbed of our history.\nThis is why we went to Senegal.\nThe late great Cheihk Anta Diop and his native Senegal have done a great job of making sure Africa has its rightful place in human history as the origin of not just human civilization but of all human life itself.\nMusicians put it in your songs, preachers put it in your sermons, And most importantly parents & teachers (in that order) make sure African children are raised knowing this history."
