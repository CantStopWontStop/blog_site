Reclaiming African History**\n\nThe Senegalese embrace and take pride in African culture and history more than any country or city I've been to. I've been to places in Africa and the diaspora where they take pride in their specific country or culture and African history as a whole. But nowhere have I seen such a display pride Africaness/Blackness. From the many museums to the names of locations to the Pan-African graffiti that decorates Dakar, there is no doubt that Senegalese are proud to be African.  \n\n::: column-margin\n![Mural of Cheikh Anta Diop on the campus of Cheikh Anta Diop University](cheikh-anta-diop-mural-ucad.jpg){fig-alt=\"Mural of Cheikh Anta Diop on the campus of Cheikh Anta Diop University\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1000\"}\n:::\n\nHistory has and is being stolen from us. All mankind has been robbed of the truth, and we as Africans have been robbed of our history. While there have been many scholars who have gone to great lengths to restore our history,[^1] it would be hard to name anyone who has done more than Dr. Cheik Anta Diop. The Senegalese polymath used his training in history, anthropology, linguistics, and chemistry to support the facts that:\n\n[^1]: In addition to Dr. Diop, here are just a few of the other scholars who have defended the Africaness of Acient Egypt:\n\n    -   Dr. John Henrik Clark\n    -   Dr. Yousef Ben Jochanan\n    -   Dr. Ivan van Sertima\n    -   Dr. Theophile Obenga\n    -   Dr. Runoko Rashidi\n    -   Dr. Christopher Ehret\n    -   Mr. Robin Walker\n    -   Dr. Anthony Browder\n    -   And many, many more\n\n-   man originated in Africa\n-   civilization originated in Africa\n-   Ancient Egypt was a Black, African civilization\n\nIn honor of his many accomplishments, the University of Dakar, where he established a radiocarbon dating laboratory, was renamed to the University of Cheikh Anta Diop. I got a chance to visit the campus and was moved by all of the Pan-African murals and graffiti covering walls.\n\n \n\n \n\n## **2. Africa's Largest Statue**\n\nThe African Renaissance Monument is a 49 m (161 ft) tall bronze statue representing the triumph of African liberation and rebirth of the African man and his family. The monument symbolizes the need to reclaim the power, heritage, and legacy of Africa.\n\n::: column-margin\n![Monument de la Renaissance Africaine (African Renaissance Monument)](african_ren_monument.jpg){width=\"1000\"}\n:::\n\nIt is the tallest statue in Africa and is taller than the Statue of Liberty and Christ the Redeemer.\n\n \n\n \n\n## **3. Gorée Island - Living Memorial of the African Holocaust**\n\nGorée Island is a small island located off the coast of Dakar. It was a hub of the Atlantic slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries. On Goree there is the House of Slaves, where captured Africans were detained before setting sail to enslavement in the West. Now a small town with \\~1,500 inhabited, Gorée also has a museum, restaurants, shops, hotels, a clinic, and a school.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](goree-island-arial.jpg)\n\n![](goree-island-slave-house.jpg)\n:::\n\n   \n\n## **4. Rapid, Widespread Development**\n\nDakar is not only a good place to learn Africa's history. It's also a place to see Africa's future. All throughout the city, there are massive commercial, residential, and infrastructural developments underway.\n\n::: container-repo\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oNJHK8mktk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"responsive-iframe\"></iframe>\n```\n\n:::\n\n \n\n \n\n## **5. Dope Art Scene**\n\nDakar has a vibrant art scene, a lot of which promotes Pan-Africanism and Black pride. Graffiti draping the entire city can be seen on buildings and bridges and whatnot. Sculptures and statues of Senegalese heroes, animals, and so much more are everywhere. And if you want to see a lot of artwork in one place, you have several museums and art galleries as options.\n\n \n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Graffiti\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![](graffiti-work-in-progress-dakar.jpg)\n\n![](graffiti-african-liberation-dakar.jpg)\n\n![](graffiti-tubman-diop-diop-dakar.jpg)\n\n![](graffiti-malcolm-x-kwame-ture-dakar.jpg)\n\n![](graffiti-leaders-dakar.png){width=\"653\"}\n\n![](graffiti-thiaroye-44-dakar.png)\n:::\n\n![](graffiti-africana-women-dakar.jpg){style=\"max-witdh: 40%; text-align: center;\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"35%\"}\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![](pharoah-ucad-dakar.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](moses-ucad-dakar.jpg)\n\n![](jesus-ucad-dakar.jpg)\n:::\n\n## Museums & Art Galleries\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![Musée des Civilisations noires (Museum of Black Civilizations)](museum-black-civilizations-senegal.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN Museum of African Arts)](musee-theodore-monod-art-africain.jpg)\n\n![Les Village des Arts (The Village of the Arts)](les-village-des-Arts.jpg)\n:::\n\n## Sculptures and Statues\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![](pyramids-corniche-dakar.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](floating-art-dakar.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](statue-radisson-dakar.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\n## **6. Shopping**\n\nDakar is a great place to shop, with a variety of traditional and modern markets offering everything from hand-woven textiles to high-tech electronics. Sandaga is a massive market with indoor malls and outdoor vendors that spans several square blocks.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n![](sandaga-shop-1.jpg)\n\n![](sandaga-shop-3.jpg)\n\n![](sandaga-shop.jpg)\n:::\n\n \n\n \n\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-c9e762d9cb84996d1668\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-c9e762d9cb84996d1668\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}},\"zoomControl\":false},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"Stamen.Toner\",null,null,{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[[14.668409260635,14.6708351496932,14.6775056430945,14.6725621429274,14.7224063451089,14.6946519538483,14.663750442254,14.7484154874838],[-17.3988146654605,-17.3995738386755,-17.4351414319068,-17.4409998874986,-17.4949110874982,-17.4712754062108,-17.4381918332471,-17.4570248697876],null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},[\"Gorée Island\",\"IFAN Historical Museum\",\"Musée des Civilisations Noires\",\"Sandaga Market\",\"African Renaissance Monument\",\"University of Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD)\",\"Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN Museum of African Arts)\",\"Les Village des Arts (The Village of the Arts)\"],null,null,null,[\"Gorée Island\",\"IFAN Historical Museum\",\"Musée des Civilisations Noires\",\"Sandaga Market\",\"African Renaissance Monument\",\"University of Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD)\",\"Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN Museum of African Arts)\",\"Les Village des Arts (The Village of the Arts)\"],{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[14.663750442254,14.7484154874838],\"lng\":[-17.4949110874982,-17.3988146654605]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
